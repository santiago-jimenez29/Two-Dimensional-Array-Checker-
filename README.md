<h1>Two Dimensional Array ModGrid</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project involves generating two randomly initialized grids, where each grid’s dimensions (number of rows and columns) and modulus value are specified by user input. These grids are represented as ModGrid objects.
Two ModGrid instances are created based on the user’s input and displayed onscreen. The program then repeatedly adds the second ModGrid to the first, updating the display after each addition. This process continues until the first grid either matches the second grid or reverts to its original state.
Each ModGrid is visually represented in a GUI using JOptionPane. The grid values are shown in individual boxes, each with a distinct background color. The interface includes a button that allows the user to advance the program step by step.
